          How to play?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Depends on how you would like to play. The main goal of the roulette is to give
          new ideas for different approaches so if you get an interesting route
          idea that doesn't follow the instructions. However, if you would like to follow
          strict rules, take a look at the metrics. Sometimes the randomizer may give
          almost impossible outputs that's why you should be the deciding factor. If you 
          have any suggestions<br>

          <h3>Suggested Metrics</h3>
          <li>Silent Assassin rating, Proffessional difficulty.
          <li>Close combat (CC) kills (Fiber Wire and melee may be distinguished by the required items in the level if asked.)
          <li>If the game asks you for a CC kill then any CC kill is allowed. If it's specified, then the player has to obtain that item from the level.
          <li>Loud and silenced weapon differences may be included.
          <li>If a specific weapon that do not exist in the level is asked, then the player can bring it through NG+ (NG+ = completion after a new game.)
          <li>If 'no knock outs' is asked then the player shouldn't try any means of KO'ing practices of NPCs.
          <li>Heading start points may not vary too much, but every level has some kind of different way of routing (e.g. suit only routing or main enterances.)
          <li>If the player is asked to obtain an item, It can be obtained anytime of the run.
          <li>Specific disguises for kills can be changed before and after objective completion.
          <li>There are bonus objectives for some of the missions with a random chance to come up.
